# Bioinf Intro Notes

1. Introduce self, asking a questions (please do, we have plenty of time for it), ask scientific/degree background (biochem, chem, biology, human biology, pharma, biomedicine)

2. Lecture is roughly divided in to these 4 sections
       Overview of relevant background molecular bilogy
       A look at sequence & structure data and data resources
       An overview of gene evolution
       Protein Function?
       Concentrating on Analyzing sequence similarity

WHY THESE THINGS? BECAUSE ALMOST ALL BIOINFORMATICS IS TO DO WITH FINDING EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT GENES/PROTEINS THAT INTEREST US

## Question - What do you think bioinfotmatics is?

Add Bioinformatics slide?

## SECTION 1 OVERVIEW OF BACKGROUND MOL BIO

MAYBE MORE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION BACKGROUND, reading frames?

3. Overview, show youtube video of DNA to protein synthesis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA
4. triplet code; redundancy, base wobble, later residues more wobble why? What would happen with no errors? What would happen with too many errors?

5. Draw some amino acids... Might redo some slides, basci aa backbone. Basic aa geometry
   physiochemical properties
   which can swap?

6. Make a bit more of the structure-function relationship

## SECTION 2: COMPUTATION REPRESENTATION OF SEQ AND STRUCT

Database size stats?
Ontologies?

4. Representation of sequences
    Do we need a mapping slide?

## SECTION 3 ANALYSING SEQUENCE DATA

CHANGE Haemoglobin examples to another pair
PAGE3, PAGE4, PAGE5 https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/9/1461.full.pdf

# Rearranging

## sections
  1. Intro mol bio and molecular evolution - throw in some more structure stuff
  2. Sequence & structure data and data resources
  3. Sequence search algorithms; smith waterman, global and local, heuristic search like blast
  4. Function prediction and other bioinformatics

### 1 Intro
  1. What the hell is bioinf?
  2. Intro biochem/mol bio
  3. Intro prot structure
  4. Intro prot function
  5. Molecular evolution

### 2 Resources
  MOSTLY KEEP
  1. NCBI - more expansive survey of what on offer
  2. NCBI seq records
  3. EMBL-EBI
  4. PDB
  5. UNIPROT

### 3 Sequence search
  KEEP EVERYTHING

### 4 Other stuff
